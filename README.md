English Lexicon project annotations
===================================

This directory contains phonological (i.e., transcription), morphological (i.e.,
morphological decomposition) and syntactic (i.e., part of speech) annotations
for the lexical data underlying the [English Lexicon
Project](http://elexicon.wustl.edu/) (ELP).

The data are distributed as a comma-separated values (CSV) spreadsheet, with a
single header row. Please see the ELP website for more information about the
fields.

This data is exactly as obtained from the ELP website and has not been modified
in any way. For this reason, pull requests that "fix" the annotations will not
be accepted.
